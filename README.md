### Instructions

Create a simple iOS app for weather forecasting. It should show the actual weather for your current location. In the forecast tab, show the forecast for the next 5 days (in 3 hour intervals) at your current location.

The app should support the current iOS version and at least 1 lower version. The project must be developed using the latest Swift version in the most recent Xcode production version.

Make sure you consider and handle all possible states of the app (offline, data not loading, errors, etc).

Prepare the app as 
if you are going to give it to the QA team before release to the App Store.
Use:
* Auto Layout and make the layout responsive for all screen sizes your app supports. We
require at least full iPhone support.
* CocoaPods and Swift (do not use Objective-C anymore).
* Open Weather Map API (​http://openweathermap.org/api​).
